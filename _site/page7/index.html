          How to install LineageOS on Wileyfox Swift
          

        </a>
      </h3><p>With the demise of Cyanogenmod and CyanogenOS people who like to keep a cheaper phone up to date will have to familiarise themselves with <a href="http://lineageos.org">LineageOS</a>. This is the fork of the latest version where CyanogenMod left off. As the company shutdown, users are left with no updates. LineageOS will resolve this for you.</p>

<p>It had been a while (8 months) since installing a new custom ROM, so I wasn’t so familiar with the TWRP recovery boot process. I had a couple of problems installing this - it seems that the latest image doesn’t work and neither does 3.0.1 - so had to go for 3.0.0. Download that to your computer, then make sure you have a working copy of <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html">adb</a>. Then in the command line with your phone plugged in via USB with USB debugging switched on, type:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>adb flash recovery twrp-3.0.0.img 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This booted and allowed me to update the files. From there it was very simple.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>adb push lineageos.zip /sdcard/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you want to install Google Apps (go for open_gapps), push that zip file to in the same way:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>adb push open_gapps.zip /sdcard/ 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If root is required push the <a href="https://download.lineageos.org/extra">addonsu zip file</a>:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>adb push addonsu.zip /sdcard/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and then run power off and reboot in to recovery mode. Once in recovery mode, you need to wipe the system and data partitions. Then, install the .zip files that you pushed earlier - firstly with the lineageos.zip, then gapps.zip and then as an optional the root zip.</p>

<p>Once you reboot, you will have a new lineageos install and have to feed in any particular personal details or Google Accounts.</p>

      </h3><p>Amazon have provided a pretty neat infrastructure with Amazon Web Services (AWS). By using this as a platform, you can quickly scale up and down provisioned resources. At times, you may experience peak demand, and AWS will allow you to respond with this. At other times, you can scale your resources down.</p>

<p>The first step in learning about this platform, is running an EC2 instance. This is the ‘machine’ behind your service. It will hold CPU/RAM and storage resources. Depending on your requirements, you can choose different types of EC2 instances.</p>

<p>A quick find will sort that</p>

<p>Run this, and you will have a file called bigfiles.txt that has the size in bytes and the filename. This does not work recursively, with the flag -maxdepth 1 preventing that.</p>

        <a class="post-link" href="/reading/2016/08/25/downloading-newspaper-using-calibre.html">
          How to download newspapers with Calibre and deliver to your Kindle
          

        </a>
      </h3><p>So, I have read a few pages which outline how to do this, but none seem to sum all of it. I’ve set up my Raspberry to download a newspaper and then deliver it daily to my Kindle. I paid for a subscription (in fact, I pay for more than one subscription) so I feel entitled to do this, as I’m supporting the journalists financially.</p>

<p>Firstly, you will need to install <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com">Calibre</a>. My RaspberryPi doesn’t have an X server running and this made it trickier, as I don’t want a lot of bloat on this machine (it’s not hugely powerful). Calibre does pull in a load of libraries, but they will only use up space, not resources. Then you will need the newspaper .recipe file. This was the trickiest part. I didn’t know how other people were getting these recipes on their machine and they didn’t seem to mention. I know that when you run Calibre through the gui you can easily choose one of the recipes. However, I didn’t have that luxury. To get around this, I visited the <a href="https://github.com/kovidgoyal/calibre/tree/master/recipes">github repository for Calibre</a> and found the .recipe file I was looking for and posted that on to the RaspberryPi.</p>

<p>Then I ran the command:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ebook-convert ./PATH-TO-CALIBRE-RECIPES/newspaper.recipe newspaper.epub --output-profile=kindle
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can change the filenames so that it suits your particular situation. Once this is run, it will look at the recipe script and start downloading the files, and constructing the .epub file. If you want to read this on your Kindle, you will need to convert it to a .mobi file.</p>

<p>Calibre will also allow you to email the file to your Kindle (this is one of the good features that Amazon have built in to the Kindle). If you have a Kobo or other e-reader, you can connect a cable and put it on your device. If you have a different way of uploading this file on to your device, please let me know in the comments below. It is possible to run Calibre as a web service, so you could browse this server from your e-reader (if it has a browser) and then download it that way.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>/usr/bin/calibre-smtp from@email.com to@email.com "Sent from" -r smtp.gmail.com -u user@gmail.com -a newspaper.epub -p password -e TLS --port 587 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This command can be put in to a script file and then called from cron.</p>

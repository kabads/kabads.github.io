      </h3><p>So, I have read a few pages which outline how to do this, but none seem to sum all of it. I’ve set up my Raspberry to download a newspaper and then deliver it daily to my Kindle. I paid for a subscription (in fact, I pay for more than one subscription) so I feel entitled to do this, as I’m supporting the journalists financially.</p>

      </h3><p>This afternoon, I met up with a few friends at a local pub. It was great catching up with everyone, but what also great was that afterwards, I planned to cycle some 15km to one of the largest hills around. I wanted to see what it was like to climb roughly 150m up a hill. And find out, I did. I didn’t quite make it all the way to the top without stopping, but I got to the top with one break just near the top. Needless to say, I will be going back to see how I fare next time.</p>

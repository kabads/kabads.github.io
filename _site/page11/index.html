          Amazon Prime Music Review
          

        </a>
      </h3><p>Amazon yesterday released the prime music service in the UK. This came at a particularly useful time for me as I’m currently not working and so have quite a bit of time to play with it. I have used spotify in the past, but not regularly as I don’t get as much time to listen to music as I would like.</p>

<p>The web interface immediately pushed me to their playlists, which this service seems to rely on heavily. The reason for that becomes apparent later on, due to the availability of 1 million tracks. Spotify claims to offer 30 million tracks and so Amazon is at a disadvantage here.</p>

<p>The tracks that Amazon offer are more like ‘classics’ in the fact that they are well known and not considered very hip. During my time with Spotify, I was off in to a weird world of music, listening to some eclectic tunes, but this doesn’t seem to be the case with Amazon Music Prime. The tracks are quite well known and not too unusual. I found this to be a little disappointing. However, the price difference is something that Amazon are trying to push here. Having already stumped up my Prime subscription, this service comes at no extra cost. So that’s £79 a year - whereas Spotify are charging in the region of £120 a year for just the music. This is where Amazon have the advantage. As I don’t have the time to consume a lot of music, Amazon seem to fit the bill.</p>

          Jekyll
          

        </a>
      </h3><p>I’ve made the switch from <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a>, which has been a great open source project, to <a href="http://www.jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. I switched host and found that my old wordpress system was just too slow. I wanted something fast. I wanted something geeky. My host charges me for the amount of processing power and I found that my prepaid amount was going down fast (and I am pretty much the only person who uses this site). So, I was being charged for writing something that not very many people were reading. They may possibly not be reading it because it took too long to load.</p>

<p>In comes Jekyll. This is a completely different way of doing something - Jekyll powers the websites on <a href="http://www.github.com">Github</a>. All the work is (usually) done on a different machine than the web server. So, all the links that need creating, all the grunt CPU intensive work, is done somewhere else. Then, clean html files are uploaded to the web server which load lightning fast. Because these are just text files you can upload them to a versioning control system, like github.</p>

<p>Overall, it’s great to get back to basic web development - everything feels clean and I’m more in touch with the content that I’m writing. Perhaps it will mean that I will want to write more (as I don’t have to wait for the wordpress instance to load up), but instead open my favourite text editor. It will be interesting to watch.</p>

          Ban encryption?
          

        </a>
      </h3><p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/whatsapp-and-snapchat-could-be-banned-under-new-surveillance-plans-9973035.html">David Cameron wants to ban encryption</a>. He thinks that the government needs to have a copy of all our communications to ensure safety. It’s a strange concept. Most day-to-day transactions rely on some form of encryption. So, those transactions might become jeopardized, or even illegal.</p>

<p>I am interested in how secure this keeps our country. What evidence exists to show that these interventions by government can prevent terrorism. I’m sure there are individuals who will use some forms of electronic devices to arrange illegal activities (and even sometimes lethal activities). However, this means that we are now limited in what we can do online. Can I chat via facetime if it uses encryption? Can I make an encrypted transaction online? If not, where does that place our country in comparison to the rest of the world?</p>

<p>Either David Cameron just wants to hit the headlines, or he doesn’t have a clue. I can’t imagine the latter, and only hope it is the former. Will Parliament debate this issue properly?</p>

      </h3><p>So, I’ve set myself a target of running 1000km this year. I realised a couple of months ago that I’ve run quite a lot this year. I got to June and had run more than any other year before. So, the idea is to keep running and get to 1000km (621 miles) by December.</p>

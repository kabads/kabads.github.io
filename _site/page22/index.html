        </a>
      </h3><p>Over at the New Statesman, they've identified the problem that the current government faces.</p>
<p>Two years ago, whilst in opposition, they were very wary of Labour's surveillance plans to monitor the public's behaviour online. However, now they are in government, they want to do the same. <a title="http://monki.biz/2k" href="http://monki.biz/2k">http://monki.biz/2k</a></p>
<p>Why the change? What is it about pledges that are made before an election is held and then once power is assumed? Why do politicians think we don't remember these pledges and easily break them just a few months into their term in government?</p>
<p>Whatever happens, people should stand up for their online privacy. OK, the huge majority of people have nothing to hide and are not carrying out illegal activities. But this is exactly why this should not go through - because most people are just using their internet connection to carry out their day-to-day lives. We do not need mass monitoring systems to maintain peace - it is already there.</p>

          Racist behaviour is illegal and should be stopped regardless of what state the victim is in.
          

        </a>
      </h3><div>When Fabrice Muamba collapsed during a recent match one jerk, named Liam Stacey, started tweeting racist abuse. Muamba wasn&#39;t aware of this, as he was unconscious and being resuscitated. However, the judicial system rightly saw this racist behaviour as worthy for the perpetrator to serve time in prison. </p>
<p>However, when a young black person was stopped by the police and racially abused, and recorded that abuse, the Crown Prosecution Service deemed it unnecessary to bring any charges against the police officer because the victim didn&#39;t suffer any distress from the racist behaviour. The guardian reports how the officer threatened the victim and used racially abusive language, just like Stacey above, but how the CPS deems it unnecessary to prosecute. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/mar/30/police-racism-black-man-abuse">http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/mar/30/police-racism-black-man-abuse</a></div>
<div></div>
<div>So, Muamba can be unconscious and the courts can sort out the racist behaviour in 2 weeks, but a guy can be physically assaulted (he alleges he was strangled and the officer admitted to it on a recording taken on a mobile phone). </div>
<div>What is the difference? Why does the CPS seemingly protect frontline officers who abuse the public? What is the agenda here? </div>
<div></div>
<div>What difference does it make if the victim is distressing or not? Racist behaviour is illegal and should be stopped regardless of what state the victim is in. </div>

          Solidarity for those on strike today
          

        </a>
      </h3><div>Not many people would know it today, as the media has not really picked up on it (apart from the Guardian) - but teachers in London were on strike today. They are asking for their pensions to be protected as they are well funded and the current coalition government has refused to carry out a review of how well the pensions are funded, which should happen every 4 years. </div>
<div>Whilst parents will be annoyed that their children have had to have a day off, would they support a reduction in their own working practices, or would they fight for what they agreed to when they started the job? </div>
<div></div>
<div>What is more, this government wants to &#39;reign in&#39; public sector pensions to prevent rising costs to the taxpayer, but at the same time, offers a reduction in tax for those earning the most (the 50% rate). Why should hard working teachers, nurses, ambulance drivers pay up more for their pension, when the most wealthy in society are receiving a tax break? </p>
<p>Are we all in this together, or, has Cameron finally revealed the true colours of the Tory-led government? </p></div>

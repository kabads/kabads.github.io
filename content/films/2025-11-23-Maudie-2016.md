---

Maudie is a quirky and unforgiving film. You will find yourself presented with mid 20th century Nova Scotia as the setting. A harsh setting for anyone to live in, even without a disability. But Maude is also disabled and finds herself reliant on her wealthy (relatively) brother. Her aunt is also unforgiving, and Maude knows that to stay in this situation, her life will have to be full of compromises. She wants freedom and independence, and so she sets out to find it.

What unravels is a lovely story about an artist and her way through life. She finds, actually earns, recognition, in a quirky and abusive relationship. She initially aims low in life, but is hard working and determined. All the qualities that cannot be argued with - and she has opponents. But her grit sees through and her work is original and sustained.

This film takes you through the life of the real life story of painter, Maude Lewis. It's not an easy watch at all. She has a very hard life, as you can imagine, but what will unveil is the true nature of a lovely human being. You will come away having learned that love can transform lives, but it's not easy, as other films try to convey.

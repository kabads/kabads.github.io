title: The Blade Itself by Joe Abercrombie
---

So, let me start off by saying that I enjoyed the first few series of Game of Thrones. Things waned as the series progressed, but I stuck with it. I wanted something manageable in the same vein. I need to be honest when I say I'd never heard heard of the genre grimdark. I thought I might enjoy it, and it turns out I do. The characters form the main backbone of the plot - they have their own backstories and aims coming from that, and this often conflicts with other characters' objectives. Watching this unfold is, to say the least, very interesting. Watching characters try to undermine each others foibles. And you're never quite sure who is on top at any given point.

The story starts with one of the characters (I can't say he is the main protagonist, as there are several), a torturer. It sets the tone for the rest of the story, which is dark and gritty. The characters are not heroes in the traditional sense, but rather anti-heroes with their own flaws and motivations. Obviously this means that a lot of the plot, that would be traditionally thought of as off-limits, is not.

Abercrombie keeps you engaged by not revealing all, right up to the very end. You will want to read the second book in the series after completing this one. This is more of an introduction to the characters and the world they inhabit, rather than a complete story in itself. The world-building is rich and immersive, with a history that feels lived-in and real.

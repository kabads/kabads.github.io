I bought this game maybe 3 years ago (pre-pandemic), and it is insanely addictive. I worked with a guy who was also an admirer of City Skylines and the huge level of detail there. We were both impressed by this. Then, on my reddit feed, Workers and Resources, Soviet Republic (WRSR) popped up on my feed. I took a look and a punt on steam and have never looked back.

The game has changed a lot since I first bought it - I'm probably on my 3rd or 4th playthrough with a republic. I realised the level of detail had changed when my son asked me what I was doing in the game and I replied that I was fertilizing the fields on the farm. Yeah - that's right. I had a low level of fertilizer and the crop failed that season, meaning I had to buy in a lot of corn from my Soviet neighbour.

So, my admiration of this game is based on many things, but won't apply to everyone. In a nutshell, I really like games that have:

 - Automation
 - Interconnected systems
 - Detail
 - Control of systems to attain efficiency

So, when I get to create a rail system whereby I pick up from a clothes factory and then deliver to the border for a profit, I get a huge sense of satisfaction. What you don't also know is that to do that I needed to build houses, with electricity, food, meat, a transport sysetm, getting people to the factory, supplying chemicals (imported) and corn from my farm - which needed vehicles and fuel, you can see what a complex supply chain looks like. Admittedly, this is probably a simple supply chain compared to real-life, but in a game, it's pretty complex and needs a little monitoring and checking every so often. You get the idea.

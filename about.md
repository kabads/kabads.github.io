I have been working in education for some time, always with a focus on technology. 

I now work in Tech, deploying services (mainly databases) in the cloud. This involves work on [Terraform](http://www.terraform.io)) and scripting languages (ruby and python). 

I'm interested in AI code and how this might help with spotting patterns in monitoring and alerting. 

If you want to contact me, please dm me on twitter with my username 'kabads'.

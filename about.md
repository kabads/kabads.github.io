I work in Tech, as a DevOps engineer. My work involves automation pipelines, so that code is automatically built, tested and deployed. This mainly involves scripting languagas (bash, python etc). I enjoy automating things where possible and like making software as 'portable' as possible.  

I'm interested in AI code and how this might help with spotting patterns in monitoring and alerting. 

If you want to contact me, please dm me on twitter with my username 'kabads'.

I have been working in education for some time, always with a focus on technology. 

I now work in Tech, deploying services (mainly databases) in the cloud. This involves work on [Terraform](http://www.terraform.io)) and scripting languages (ruby and python).

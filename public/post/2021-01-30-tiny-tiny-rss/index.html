     <p><a href="https://tt-rss.org">Tiny Tiny RSS</a> is a simple syndication application.  I&rsquo;ve been using RSS syndication readers for a long time. I just don&rsquo;t have time to scour the web to check if a website had added new content. I started with <a href="https://www.google.com/reader/about/">Google Reader</a> a long time ago (as did many of us), but was also sad that it went away. So, then I moved to <a href="https://newsblur.com/">Newsblur</a>. This suited me and helped me read my blog posts for another year or so. It also has (or had - I haven&rsquo;t checked recently) an open source model. However, with the pricing it was offering, I didn&rsquo;t need to host it myself as it was doing just a fine job, for the price that I paid. Then the price went up. For some reason, I felt that it was too much. I was probably hasty, but also ready for a change.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I switched my feeds to <a href="https://theoldreader.com">The Old Reader</a>. This was an obvious attempt to recreate the experience with Google reader.</p>
<p>Recently, I installed <a href="https://tt-rss.org">TinyTinyRss</a> on a raspberry pi. There was a package already, but it attempted to install Apache - but I was already running Nginx, so didn&rsquo;t want this extra dependency - I therefore downloaded the source code, put it in a directory that was served via the webserver and everything worked instantly. I had already creaed a database and user/pass combination in mariadb, so the setup was simple. At this point, I imported an ~.ompl~ file that I already had. I then read about running the update script. I started a tmux terminal and issued the command ~/usr/bin/php /path/to/tt-rss/update.php &ndash;feeds &ndash;quiet~ and this runs automatically.</p>
<p>You can add feeds using the following dialogue:</p>

<p>The output is really good to look at:</p>

<p>There is also an <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.fox.ttrss">app for your phone</a> to hook up to your server, so you can read your articles on the go.</p>

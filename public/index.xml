      <description>Salesforce, for those of you who might have been living under a rock, is a customer relationship management tool. I work with developers who develop code for salesforce. We follow the usual CI/CD route, but have been dependent on 3rd party tools to authenticate to a Salesforce Org. This is OK, but not ideal, so I set about authenticating to Salesforce with JWT. The official documentation is here: https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_auth_jwt_flow.htm. This sets out the following steps:</description>

      <guid>//home.monkeez.org/hugo/2021/01/30/Tiny-Tiny-RSS.html</guid>
      <description>Tiny Tiny RSS is a simple syndication application. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using RSS syndication readers for a long time. I just don&amp;rsquo;t have time to scour the web to check if a website had added new content. I started with Google Reader a long time ago (as did many of us), but was also sad that it went away. So, then I moved to Newsblur. This suited me and helped me read my blog posts for another year or so.</description>

      <guid>//home.monkeez.org/hugo/2020/12/22/Verify-Azure-Blob-Storage-Automatically.html</guid>
      <description>This blog post outlines a problem I had whereby there were lots of files in Azure storage and I wanted to check that they had been uploaded correctly.
Problem You want to verify lots of files that have uploaded to Azure Blob Storage? Look no further. https://github.com/kabads/md5sum.
So, I had to upload a lot of media assets for work in a hurry as a server was being shut down. We had Azure, and as these were static files, that seemed like a good solution.</description>

      <guid>//home.monkeez.org/hugo/2020/04/21/Apache-Rewrite-Mod.html</guid>
      <description>mod_rewrite is a powerful module that Apache can utilize. It is a way of rewriting URLs, modifying the request that Apache recieves. This could be a moved document, or enforcing SSL (rewriting the URL from http to https).
This is a complex subject, which cannot be covered here, but for further information, refer to the full documentation. Rewrite rules can exist in a .htaccess file, or the main configuration file, or preferably a &amp;lt;Directory&amp;gt; stanza.</description>

      <description>Rsyslog (aka syslog) can pull in logs from journald, via the socket (using imuxsock module) or a specific module that taps in to a socket that is journald runs (imjournal) with very little config. imjournal specialises in logging that is structured (e.g. logs that follow json structure) and then filtering or querying logs. As a result, imjournal is more expensive. These modules are already loaded by default inrsyslog.conf file and do not need adding in any other configuration files.</description>

      <guid>//home.monkeez.org/hugo/2020/01/03/SELinux-Users-Roles-and-Types.html</guid>
      <description>SELinux contexts follow the SELinux user:role:type:level syntax.
Users Users can be seen with the command:
semanage user -l This will show the list of SELinux users, and is mapped to Linux users. If a Linux user is not listed then they are associated with the __default__ SELinux user and inherit those rights.
Roles Role based access control is a go-between from the user to the domain. By assigning roles, a user can access particular domains.</description>

      <guid>//home.monkeez.org/hugo/draft/2019-12-30-selinux.html</guid>
      <description>SELinux (Security Enhanced Linux) is a linux kernel security module that provides a mechanism for supporting access control policies. This can support the protection from tampering and bypassing threats that might be possible with certain applications. SELinux checks permissions after the usual operating system permissions (user, groups and read/write/execute policies). If the local permissions succeeds, then SELinux checks for permissions.
A Linux kernel that uses SELinux enforces mandatory access control policies that confine user programs and system services, also including file and network resources.</description>

      <guid>//home.monkeez.org/hugo/2019/12/30/Setting-Filesystem-ACLs-on-Linux.html</guid>
      <description>ACLs are a method for defining access to files and directories on a system. These can be set at the user level, group level, or via the effective rights mask.
The commands getfacl and setfacl are used to get and change ACL permissions respectively. If you are setting for a specific user then the text form of the attribute is user:username:rwx. If you want the permission to apply to the default user (or group) then you would use the text term user::rwx</description>

      <description>This post outlines the steps needed to create a qemu environment within a machine and install virtual machines in that environment.
Software required:
 qemu-kvm libvirt virt-install virt-manager  virt-manager is a graphical interface to the resources, and is optional according to whether you run a graphical interface.
Networking One of the important tasks before installing a virtual machine is to set up the virtual networking. This means that as the VM installs, it can work with the networking.</description>

      <description>Terraform is a great tool for creating infrastructure. It&amp;rsquo;s almost becoming the &amp;lsquo;de-facto&amp;rsquo; standard. This post will outline how to create multiple resources with just one code block.
The oldest form of looping through a Terraform code block is the count primitive. By defining this, the run of terraform will loop over that resource for the count that has been defined. However, when defining names, the count will need to be used to name the resoure, as follows:</description>

      <guid>//home.monkeez.org/hugo/draft/2019-07-29-arrays-with-ruby.html</guid>
      <description>Ruby has extensive coverage for arrays (sometimes called lists if you are coming from a Python background). Arrays are for collecting information all in one place, or in a list. Arrays are sequential, which means that they don&amp;rsquo;t change order once set. Arrays are mutable (they can change items in the list).
Declaring an Array Here is an example of an array:
scores = [14, 12, 4, 20, 19]  These scores can be for a particular person in a particular test or activity.</description>

      <description>If you are coming from using python, then you will be used to using a lot of if...elif...else statements to catch conditions in variables. Sometimes this can be tedious - in Ruby it is easier to use case statements.
Let&amp;rsquo;s assume that you are checking for ages of people and want to classify them according to their age (it might be a sceranio of runners in a race and you want to find out who won each age range).</description>

      <description>Ruby has great string support. This post summarises the functions that are available.
This is not designed to be a tutorial for others, but rather a record for myself in learning Ruby.
.downcase This method turns any characters in a string to lowercase.
a = &amp;quot;My String&amp;quot;.downcase  returns
&amp;quot;my string&amp;quot;  .upcase .upcase method does the opposite of downcase. It will change the case of any lowercase characters to uppercase.</description>

      <description>Chernobyl has screened on Sky Atlantic over the last few weeks. It represents a dramatic representation of the disaster back in 1986, which for a lot of people, is still in living memory.
The people who staffed the reactor experienced an explosion during a test around 1:25am. They didn&amp;rsquo;t expect this to happen. The whole incident led to an explosion that devastated the surrounding areas with radioactive contamination. This acts as the backdrop for the drama written by Craig Mazin.</description>

      <description>MySQL replication is a good thing to have. It provides greater resilience and removes a single point of failure. By following these steps, you will create a replica of a master server, acting as a permanent backup in the case of a DR scenario.
Introduction MySQL servers can be a single point of failure if you have not set up a good back-up infrastructure. It is difficult to get a good back-up infrastructure in place, without some time spent out of service.</description>

      <description>Autofs is a way of auto-mounting devices to a running system. Theses steps will walk through enabling it on an Archlinux system.
What is Autofs? It mounts a filesystem that is not always connected (e.g. network or device). Once a connection is made to that device, then autofs will handle the mounting of that device. It can also handle unmounting of a device, if it becomes unavailable. /etc/fstab automatically tries to mount during boot - however, it won&amp;rsquo;t try to mount once a device is connected after boot.</description>

      <description>Terraform is a cloud orchestration scripting language. This allows the capturing of cloud infrastructure. Instead of relying on your network and resources to be sat whilst you work on other projects, by using terraform, you can tear-down your infrastructure and then create it again from where you left of (saving money on the infrastructure that would be incurring a cost).
Another advantage is that what you are creating is a resource for the project that is reproducible.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve been using Linux for a few years, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably remember that 100MB for a /boot partition was no problem. However, that has changed. Whilst you don&amp;rsquo;t need a datacentre for a /boot partitions, you might want to install other kernels to help you tweak your system and yet not delete kernels that you are using.
This article makes a few assumptions - you will be using systemd-boot to boot and you are familiar with resizing partitions, mounting them and moving files around.</description>

      <description>AWS allows you to create your own virtual private cloud (or VPC). This is a network within which your machines will communicate. You can control the level of access across your VPC through subnets, Network Access Control Lists and Security Groups.
Network Access Control lists allow particular traffic in and outbound, but are stateless; that is, if you allow traffic in, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean that traffic will leave the network.</description>

      <description>TADS - Teresa, Adam, Dave and Shep walking. We have been walking for about 2 years now, all around the South East. This was our longest walk by far in two days. Swindon to Goring.
The walk started out with us meeting at Swindon having lunch. There seemed to be quite a lot going on in the town with Canadian flags and guys at the train station with Ice Hockey sticks.</description>

      <description>With the demise of Cyanogenmod and CyanogenOS people who like to keep a cheaper phone up to date will have to familiarise themselves with LineageOS. This is the fork of the latest version where CyanogenMod left off. As the company shutdown, users are left with no updates. LineageOS will resolve this for you.
It had been a while (8 months) since installing a new custom ROM, so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t so familiar with the TWRP recovery boot process.</description>

      <description>Amazon have provided a pretty neat infrastructure with Amazon Web Services (AWS). By using this as a platform, you can quickly scale up and down provisioned resources. At times, you may experience peak demand, and AWS will allow you to respond with this. At other times, you can scale your resources down.
The first step in learning about this platform, is running an EC2 instance. This is the &amp;lsquo;machine&amp;rsquo; behind your service.</description>

      <description>I have directories that agedu shows as having large files. However, agedu doesn&amp;rsquo;t tell me what the names of the files are.
A quick find will sort that
find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -exec \/usr\/bin\/ls -al {} \; | awk &#39;{print $5,$9}&#39; | sort -nr &amp;gt; bigfiles.txt  Run this, and you will have a file called bigfiles.txt that has the size in bytes and the filename. This does not work recursively, with the flag -maxdepth 1 preventing that.</description>

      <description>So, I have read a few pages which outline how to do this, but none seem to sum all of it. I&amp;rsquo;ve set up my Raspberry to download a newspaper and then deliver it daily to my Kindle. I paid for a subscription (in fact, I pay for more than one subscription) so I feel entitled to do this, as I&amp;rsquo;m supporting the journalists financially.
Firstly, you will need to install Calibre.</description>

      <description>Having gone to one of the best destinations I&amp;rsquo;ve probably ever been to, I felt the need to document it in a more formal way. I was inspired by the Cuban culture and vibrant life to record some of the sights I&amp;rsquo;d seen.
I like the achitecture of buildings. Once they were part of the finery of Havana, but since then, people don&amp;rsquo;t have the money to upkeep this kind of large building, hence its appearance.</description>

      <description>This afternoon, I met up with a few friends at a local pub. It was great catching up with everyone, but what also great was that afterwards, I planned to cycle some 15km to one of the largest hills around. I wanted to see what it was like to climb roughly 150m up a hill. And find out, I did. I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite make it all the way to the top without stopping, but I got to the top with one break just near the top.</description>

      <title>Using sed</title>

      <guid>//home.monkeez.org/hugo/2016/02/20/using-sed/</guid>
      <description>sed is a quick command line utility to change text within a file, or input stream. Typically, it is used within a pipe situation (i.e. using the character | on the command line). If you are not familiar with that command, you will need to research that before continuing.
A simple use of sed is to replace characters in a stream or file. This is done using regular expressions. This will help you search for a set of characters and then replace them with the alternative.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the find command simply since I can remember, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never really got to see the true power of this command. Combined with the -exec flag this command can throw up a lot of different uses. -exec allows you to work with other bash commands and operate on them.
A basic use would look like this:
$ find . -name &amp;quot;*&amp;quot; -type f -size +10M -exec rm {} \;  Let&amp;rsquo;s break this down.</description>

Uses Firewalls allow only particular access to particular network ports and paths. You can remove access to a port or a specific IP address or a range of IP addresses.
Admins can apply rules according to what access they would like - these rules include both outgoing and incoming network traffic.</description>

      <guid>//home.monkeez.org/hugo/2015/12/22/how-to-enable-disk-quotas-linux/</guid>
      <description>Linux allows setting quotas on a filesystem. This will prevent users from using more diskspace than they are allowed. This can also be used to manage group allowances to enforce the allowance for a collection of users. Stopping users from filling up a diskspace can be an important on a shared system as filling up a physical disk drive can bring a system down, or make it unstable.
Steps Initially, you will need to mount a filesystem with a &amp;lsquo;usrquota&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;groupquota&amp;rsquo; command passed in /etc/fstab.</description>

      <guid>//home.monkeez.org/hugo/2015/12/05/encrypt-a-partition/</guid>
      <description>An encrypted partition can add a layer of security to your system. When initialized, it will ask for the passphrase which, if unavailable, will not allow proper mounting. This renders the information on the drive as unreadable.
Most systems use the Linux Unified Key Setup (LUKS for short) format for encryption and this can be a standard install for most distribution.
Steps for setting up LUKS Setting up the drive Firstly you should have a partition drive that is unmounted and unformatted (no filesystem).</description>

      <title>How and why you should be using 2 factor authentication</title>

      <guid>//home.monkeez.org/hugo/2015/10/31/how-and-why-2-factor-authentication/</guid>
      <description>Two factor authentication provides another layer of security to any sign in for services you use. By enabling 2 factor authentication, you are using another layer of security when signing in. However, this extra layer of security is a physical one, not necessarily digital. The 2 factor authentication requires a particular object which cannot be replicated. This can be the form of a USB key or a mobile phone. Banks have used this before with card readers which produce a particular code.</description>

      <guid>//home.monkeez.org/hugo/2015/10/18/groups-explained/</guid>
      <description>Users on a linux system belong to at least one group. Groups allow a systems administrator to create parts of the filesystem where a group of users can share files. They also allow a group of users to access particular commands or resources on the system, that other users might not be able to access.
Groups are defined in the /etc/group file, which is only root writeable.
To create a group, the groupadd command is used.</description>

      <description>Not familiar with git? Start with an online book or Version Control with Git.
Git is an open sourced source control software system. It allows coders to manage large projects remotely and on their own machine. Each contributor will hold their own version of the code on their machine and can manipulate that however they wish. Eventually, they can push back their contributions to a remote repository.
This workflow design can also be great for managing content, although that content does have to be in text format - git will allow binary files to be uploaded and managed, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow for differences between files to be shown - this can only be done with plain text files.</description>

      <description>RAID disks offer particular advantages over ordinary single disk set up. Data redundancy is improved (consider it to be a continuous backup) and also significant performance can be seen with the correct configuration.
There are different types of RAID levels and each level will need to be chosen on a use-case:
  RAID 0: Uses only striping - this makes two disks appear like one larger disk. Provides a performance boost when accessing disks.</description>

      <description>What are the advantages of Logical Volume Management (LVM)?
LVM treats your physical harddrives as &amp;lsquo;elastic&amp;rsquo; storage - that is extents can be across disks allowing filesystems to be across many disks and/or partitions. This allows a lot of flexibility and can allow filesystems to shrink or grow easily.
There is a small disadvantage when using LVM - there is an overhead when reading and writing to disk - which doesn&amp;rsquo;t normally happen when writing to a normal block disk.</description>

They are expected to deliver a better educational experience for less money (per head). How could they possibly do this, knowing that even now they are challenged with their budgets?
When people pick up new technology they usually have to learn how to use the device - this is included in new operating systems that are released.</description>

This came at a particularly useful time for me as I&amp;rsquo;m currently not working and so have quite a bit of time to play with it. I have used spotify in the past, but not regularly as I don&amp;rsquo;t get as much time to listen to music as I would like.
The web interface immediately pushed me to their playlists, which this service seems to rely on heavily.</description>

      <description>David Cameron wants to ban encryption. He thinks that the government needs to have a copy of all our communications to ensure safety. It&amp;rsquo;s a strange concept. Most day-to-day transactions rely on some form of encryption. So, those transactions might become jeopardized, or even illegal.
I am interested in how secure this keeps our country. What evidence exists to show that these interventions by government can prevent terrorism. I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are individuals who will use some forms of electronic devices to arrange illegal activities (and even sometimes lethal activities).</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve just got the VPS bug. A VPS is a virtual private server, which means you get root access to a server of your choice at a very low cost (as opposed to a dedicated server).
I&#39;ve managed to get some pretty cheap deals which manage services that I used to run in my house (using computers up and valuable space).
One of the servers now runs my media and another (my favourite) runs minecraft (www.</description>

      <description>Over at the New Statesman, they&#39;ve identified the problem that the current government faces.
Two years ago, whilst in opposition, they were very wary of Labour&#39;s surveillance plans to monitor the public&#39;s behaviour online. However, now they are in government, they want to do the same. http://monki.biz/2k
Why the change? What is it about pledges that are made before an election is held and then once power is assumed? Why do politicians think we don&#39;t remember these pledges and easily break them just a few months into their term in government?</description>

      <description>When Fabrice Muamba collapsed during a recent match one jerk, named Liam Stacey, started tweeting racist abuse. Muamba wasn&amp;#39;t aware of this, as he was unconscious and being resuscitated. However, the judicial system rightly saw this racist behaviour as worthy for the perpetrator to serve time in prison. However, when a young black person was stopped by the police and racially abused, and recorded that abuse, the Crown Prosecution Service deemed it unnecessary to bring any charges against the police officer because the victim didn&amp;#39;t suffer any distress from the racist behaviour.</description>

      <description>Not many people would know it today, as the media has not really picked up on it (apart from the Guardian) - but teachers in London were on strike today. They are asking for their pensions to be protected as they are well funded and the current coalition government has refused to carry out a review of how well the pensions are funded, which should happen every 4 years.  Whilst parents will be annoyed that their children have had to have a day off, would they support a reduction in their own working practices, or would they fight for what they agreed to when they started the job?</description>

      <description>Teachers will have to contribute 50% more to their pensions over the next three years at a time when top earners can look forward to a cut in the 50p top rate of tax, said Blower.

      <description>Back in 2009 Cameron vowed to open government to the masses (&#34;We will begin a massive redistribution of power in our country, from the powerful to the powerless, from the political elite to the man and the woman in the street.&#34; - http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8067505.stm) and yet he refuses to disclose which big donors have been for dinner - (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17508271).
Is this really the &#34;massive redistribution of power&#34; that we were expecting?</description>

      <description>I introduced Edmodo to my ICT club this afternoon and they enjoyed it. Basically, it&#39;s an online learning environment that is private to you and your groups. You give your children a code when they sign up which enrols them on your course automatically. The children found it difficult to find a username that hadn&#39;t already been chosen, but after some perseverance they all got on, children from year 3 to year 6.</description>

It&#39;s early days and I&#39;ve still made a loss on the whole venture, but the fact that people think my software has real value that they are prepared to pay for, is even more surprising.&amp;nbsp;
I put up a video on youtube of the video to show people what it looks like when they are using it, which I think is the selling point.</description>

      <description> http://monki.biz/1r Publishing is a tough industry to be in, no doubt about it. Things are rapidly changing and market forces are being swayed beyond the traditional publisher&#39;s influence. Things are now so easy to share and distribute, that these old gate-keepers can no longer steer what people are looking at.

      <description>The film soylent green is about people being harvested for food. That&amp;#39;s how I see Facebook. Your details are being harvested for business and advertising. Sure, it can be beneficial to stay in touch with each other, but there&amp;#39;s a bigger price to pay. I&amp;#39;ve come to the decision that the amount of information I&amp;#39;m getting from other people isn&amp;#39;t worth the price I&amp;#39;m paying for that lack of privacy and having my details flogged to advertisers.</description>

      <description> I&#39;ve been working on a little side project to learn programming (this is the year of coding apparently).&amp;nbsp;
http://www.reporteasy.co.uk
This is a little application that assists with writing pupil reports for teachers - it automates a lot of the text entry that often takes a long time.&amp;nbsp;

      <description>I&#39;ve signed up to google music - not sure if I like the way spotify is going. I don&#39;t like having to have a facebook account (not that I had one when I initially signed up) and I don&#39;t like the way spotify are going about publishing details about my music preferences even though I haven&#39;t signed up for it.&amp;nbsp;
So, for a while - goodbye spotify and hello google music.</description>

I've been using RSS syndication readers for a long time. I just don't have time to scour the web to check if a website had added new content. I started with [Google Reader](https://www.google.com/reader/about/) a long time ago (as did many of us), but was also sad that it went away. 

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/kabads/50891546277/in/dateposted/" title="ttrss1"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50891546277_90a54ae621_w.jpg" width="400" height="183" alt="ttrss1"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

So, then I moved to [Newsblur](https://newsblur.com/). This suited me and kept me going. It also has (or had - I haven't checked recently) an open source model. However, with the pricing it was offering, I didn't need to host it myself as it was doing just a fine job, for the price that I paid. Then the price went up. For some reason, I felt that it was too much. I was probably hasty, but also ready for a change. 

I switched my feeds to [The Old Reader](https://theoldreader.com). This was an obvious attempt to recreate the experience with Google reader.
